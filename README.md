# RPG game

What is this about? It's just a fun little side project of mine.  
Besides, this is a great place to copy and paste text reading  
or text editing code. Cogs.py has the functions like edit_txt  
read_txt and most importantly, find_index which can be used to  
set up an efficient login system. Thanks to TheSpam on repl.it  
allowing me to shamelessly copy code and help me beat a specific  
person in a rpg game war.
